Google is being clever here, ramping up its quality threshold. We have seen multiple recent examples of vacuous but seemingly harmless apps getting onto Play Store and then either being used as a conduit to other malware-laced apps, or more recently used as evil-twin decoys for those alternatives.
 
If one assumes that most dangerous apps on Play Store serve little legitimate purpose, then this is an excellent approach to tightening the net. As such, while purging apps is not new for Google, this time it feels different. There is a building expectation that this will even hit some popular apps with millions of installs, and some legitimate apps which are low on the quality mark will also fail to make the cut.

**Google Play**, also known as the **Google Play Store** or **Play Store** and formerly **Android Market**, is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google.
